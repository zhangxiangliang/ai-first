# LLM Wiki

A pattern for building personal knowledge bases using LLMs.

This is an idea file, it is designed to be copy pasted to your own LLM Agent (e.g. OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode / Pi, or etc.). Its goal is to communicate the high level idea, but your agent will build out the specifics in collaboration with you.

## The core idea

Most people's experience with LLMs and documents looks like RAG: you upload a collection of files, the LLM retrieves relevant chunks at query time, and generates an answer. This works, but the LLM is rediscovering knowledge from scratch on every question. There's no accumulation. Ask a subtle question that requires synthesizing five documents, and the LLM has to find and piece together the relevant fragments every time. Nothing is built up. NotebookLM, ChatGPT file uploads, and most RAG systems work this way.

The idea here is different. Instead of just retrieving from raw documents at query time, the LLM **incrementally builds and maintains a persistent wiki** — a structured, interlinked collection of markdown files that sits between you and the raw sources. When you add a new source, the LLM doesn't just index it for later retrieval. It reads it, extracts the key information, and integrates it into the existing wiki — updating entity pages, revising topic summaries, noting where new data contradicts old claims, strengthening or challenging the evolving synthesis. The knowledge is compiled once and then *kept current*, not re-derived on every query.

This is the key difference: **the wiki is a persistent, compounding artifact.** The cross-references are already there. The contradictions have already been flagged. The synthesis already reflects everything you've read. The wiki keeps getting richer with every source you add and every question you ask.

## Architecture

There are three layers:

**Raw sources** — your curated collection of source documents. These are immutable — the LLM reads from them but never modifies them.

**The wiki** — a directory of LLM-generated markdown files. The LLM owns this layer entirely. It creates pages, updates them when new sources arrive, maintains cross-references, and keeps everything consistent.

**The schema** — a document (e.g. `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`) that tells the LLM how the wiki is structured, what the conventions are, and what workflows to follow when ingesting sources, answering questions, or maintaining the wiki.

## Operations

**Ingest.** Read a source, discuss key takeaways, write or update wiki pages, update the index, and append to the log.

**Query.** Answer from the wiki first. When useful, write the result back into the wiki as a new persistent page.

**Lint.** Periodically health-check the wiki for contradictions, stale claims, missing cross-references, or gaps worth researching.

## Indexing and logging

**index.md** is the navigation layer for the wiki.

**log.md** is the chronological record of what changed and why.

## Note

This document is intentionally abstract. It describes the pattern, not a single fixed implementation. The exact directory structure, naming rules, and page formats should be decided by the local schema and evolved over time.
